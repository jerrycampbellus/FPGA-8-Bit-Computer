<h1 align=center style='text-align:center'>FPGA 8 Bit Computer Based on Ben
Eater's Discrete Component Design and Implementation</h1>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>                </span>Ben's approach
to building the 8-bit computer and his logical, linear, and practical style explain
concepts. Like many people who found Ben Eater's 8-bit computer project on
YouTube, the series was highly informative and engaging. And it inspired me to
take on this project.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Although I did not build his design
using discrete integrated circuit components, I did think there would be value
in creating a working implementation with an FPGA, field-programmable gate
array. An exciting challenge and complementary project to the original design.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>                </span>There
are several notable examples of using an FPGA to realize full computers or
individual components such as the CPU, video card, and I/O devices. This
project designs and implements the same elements in Ben's initial design but
uses an FPGA development card instead of breadboards and ICs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>                </span>The
following description includes the original Verilog source code and top-level
constraint files for the Terasic FPGA development board, utilizing a MAX10 FPGA
IC from Alterra. The source files and the project archives from Altera's
Quartus Prime software IDE are included.</p>
